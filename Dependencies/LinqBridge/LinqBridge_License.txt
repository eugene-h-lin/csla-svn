LINQBridge is free—and I don't place any restrictions on what you can do with the source code.
The internal implementation is my own; however Microsoft came up with the idea of having a
set of query operators with those names and functioning in that manner. So you may run into
some restrictions if you use this outside the purpose for which it was intended.

Obviously no guarantees are made, and no liability is accepted for any losses or complications.
